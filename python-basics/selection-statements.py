def booleanClass():
    """
    Python provides a boolean class which defines the two values True and False for use with logical expressions. Python will implicitly convert other types to a boolean when necessary. The basic rules are

    Non-zero numeric values are converted to True while a value of zero, both integer and floating-point, is False.
    1. For all other types, the values are converted to True if the object is nonempty and False when they are empty.
    2. The built-in function bool( x ) can be used to convert value x to a boolean using these standard rules.

    An empty literal string ("") is considered empty and will evaluate to False.
